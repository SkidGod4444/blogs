title: Build your own Custom Database using TypeScript
description: This project will help you grasp low-level systems without requiring any prior knowledge of database engineering. I’ve included all the essential details to guide you through how everything works, and I’ve also used ChatGPT to strengthen my understanding of the concepts. Hope this helps you.

## Introduction
As a developer, I wanted to understand how databases work under the hood, including data structures like 
<b>B-Trees</b> and <b>Red-Black Trees</b>. Instead of just reading about them, I decided to build my own database from scratch in 
TypeScript. This post outlines my journey of creating <b>LumeDB</b>, an <b>industry-ready, file-based, and performant database</b>.

## Technologies

Feel free to choose any other alternatives you are familiar with. These are my choices:

- [***TypeScript***](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - We'll be using TypeScript as our core language but you can go along with **GO** lang.
- [***Bun***](https://bun.sh/) - We'll be using Bun as our runtime.
- [***Docker***](https://www.docker.com/) - We'll need to dockerize everything in order to scale & run multiple database instances in containers. 
- [***Hono.Js***](https://hono.dev/) - We'll be using Hono to build Ultrafast & Lightweight API endpoints.

## Project Setup

- **Language & Runtime:** TypeScript + Bun
- **Folder Structure:**

```bash
├── src/
│   ├── storage/
│   │   ├── file.mngr.ts  # File handling logic
│   ├── server.ts         # HTTP API for the database
│   ├── cli.ts            # Command Line Interface
│   ├── main.ts           # Entry point
├── data/                 # Stores database files
├── Dockerfile            # Docker setup
├── docker-compose.yml    # Container orchestration
```

- **Storage Choice:** Binary files (.bin) for efficient data retrieval

##  File-Based Storage Implementation
- Implemented a **FileManager** to handle reading and writing efficiently:
